# Decode Function Results
Use this file to decode validation results from `SeaportValidator`. The return value from most `SeaportValidator` functions is a `ErrorsAndWarnings` struct which contains two `uint16` arrays. First is the errors and second is the warnings. See below for the value of codes.
